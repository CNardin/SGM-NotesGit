\section{Article Notes}
\subsection{A spectral-based stochastic ground motion model with a non-parametric time-modulating function, Broccardo, M., Dabaghi, M., ICOSSAR 2017}
We develop a spectral-based parameterized stochastic model of broadband ground motion.
The model employs a modulated and filtered white-noise process defined via Evolutionary
Power Spectral Density (EPSD). For the time-modulating function, we propose a novel non-parametric function based on a monotonic cubic spline interpolation. The spectral non-stationarity is described by a time-frequency modulating function defined by four
meaningful engineering parameters, namely main frequency and bandwidth of the motion in the strong phase, and their rates of change with respect to time.
To ensure zero residual velocity and displacement, a
high-pass filter is applied according to the evolutionary theory of Priestley. This in
conjunction with an energy correction factor eliminates a bias on the cumulative energy of the post-processed simulated motions.
