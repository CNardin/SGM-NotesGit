abstract = {The problem of updating a structural model and its associated uncertainties by utilizing dynamic
response data is addressed using a Bayesian statistical framework that can handle the inherent ill-conditioning
and possible nonuniqueness in model updating applications. The objective is not only to give more accurate
response predictions for prescribed dynamic loadings but also to provide a quantitative assessment of this
accuracy. In the methodology presented, the updated (optimal) models within a chosen class of structural models
are the most probable based on the structural data if all the models are equally plausible a priori. The prediction
accuracy of the optimal structural models is given by also updating probability models for the prediction error.
The precision of the parameter estimates of the optimal structural models, as well as the precision of the optimal
prediction-error parameters, can be examined. A large-sample asymptotic expression is given for the updated
predictive probability distribution of the uncertain structural response, which is a weighted average of the
predictive probability distributions for each optimal model. This predictive distribution can be used to make
model predictions despite possible nonuniqueness in the optimal models.},

abstract = {The problem of model identifiability is addressed. The goal is to find all the structural models within a specified class that produce the same output at a set of observed degrees of freedom as a given model in the class when they are all subjected to the same input. A new algorithm is presented to solve this problem for a class of multi-degree-of-freedom linear structural models, and the approach is illustrated with examples.},

@article{Mustafa2015,
abstract = {A Bayesian probabilistic methodology is presented for structural model updating using incomplete measured modal data which also takes into account different types of errors such as modelling errors due to the approximation of actual complex structure, uncertainties introduced by variation in material and geometric properties, measurement errors due to the noises in the signal and the data processing. The present work uses Linear Optimization Problems (LOP) to compute the probability that continually updated the model parameters. A real life rail-cum-roadway long steel truss bridge (Saraighat bridge) is considered in the present study, where identified modal data are available from measured acceleration responses due to ambient vibration. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the introduction of sufficient number of model parameters at the element property level in order to capture any variations in the sectional properties; (2) the development of an accurate baseline model by utilizing limited sensor data; (3) the implementation of a probabilistic damage detection approach that utilizes updated model parameters from the undamaged state and possibly damaged state of the structure.},

@article{Wagner2020,
abstract = {A common approach to assess the performance of fire insulation panels is the component additive method (CAM). The parameters of the CAM are based on the temperature-dependent thermal material properties of the panels. These material properties can be derived by calibrating finite element heat transfer models using experimentally measured temperature records. In the past, the calibration of the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches, which was inefficient and prone to error. In this contribution, the calibration problem is reformulated in a probabilistic setting and solved using the Bayesian model calibration framework. This not only gives a set of best-fit parameters but also confidence bounds on the latter. To make this framework feasible, the procedure is accelerated through the use of advanced surrogate modelling techniques: polynomial chaos expansions combined with principal component analysis. This surrogate modelling technique additionally allows one to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis at no additional cost by giving access to the Sobol' indices. The calibration is finally validated by using the calibrated material properties to predict the temperature development in different experimental setups.},
